# SquadQueue

A self-hosted game backlog and voting system for a friend group — a private "Personal Shelf" plus shared "Communal Rooms," real pricing from gg.deals, and a 5-emoji voting scale.

This is Milestone 1: a working vertical slice (auth, game intake with real pricing, rooms, voting) meant to run locally and be iterated on.

## Stack

Node/TypeScript monorepo — Fastify API, React (Vite) frontend, PostgreSQL via Prisma, Redis for caching/sessions. `packages/shared` holds types shared between server and web.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ and npm
- Docker Desktop (for Postgres + Redis locally, and for the production image)
- A free [gg.deals API key](https://gg.deals/api/) (account settings → API) — used for live Steam pricing
- A free IGDB app via [Twitch developer console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps) (Category: "Application Integration") — used for game search/identity
- Optionally, a sign-in method (Google, Discord, Steam, or a generic OIDC provider like Authelia/Keycloak/Authentik) — or use the local dev bypass below while you build

## First-time setup

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set GGDEALS_API_KEY, IGDB_CLIENT_ID and IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET at minimum. Leave
# DEV_FAKE_AUTH=true and the sign-in vars blank to sign in as a hardcoded dev user until
# you've set up a real sign-in method.

npm install

# start Postgres + Redis in Docker
docker compose --env-file .env up -d

# create the database schema
npm run db:push

# start the API (port 3000) and the Vite dev server (port 5173) together
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173. With `DEV_FAKE_AUTH=true` you're signed in automatically as a dev user — no sign-in method needed yet.

Useful commands:
- `npm run db:studio` — opens Prisma Studio, a GUI to browse/edit the database directly.
- `npm run build` — production build of all three packages (used by the Docker image too).
- `npm test` — runs the Vitest suite (pure logic only — sort/recommendation rules, platform
  mapping, duplicate-scope rules; no DB/network integration tests).

## Setting up real sign-in

Once you're ready to move off the dev bypass, set `DEV_FAKE_AUTH=false` and configure one or more sign-in methods in `.env` — the login screen shows a button for each one that's fully filled in.

- **Google**: create an OAuth client at [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/) (APIs & Services → Credentials), fill in `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- **Discord**: create an application at [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) → OAuth2, fill in `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`/`DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`.
- **Steam**: grab a free Web API key at [steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey), fill in `STEAM_API_KEY`. Steam uses a different, older login protocol (OpenID 2.0, not OAuth2) and doesn't need a client id/secret — just the key. Steam accounts have no email address, so users who sign in with Steam get a placeholder one under the hood.
- **Generic OIDC**: any standards-compliant provider (Authelia, Keycloak, Authentik, ...) — fill in `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`/`OIDC_CLIENT_ID`/`OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`.

Each method's `*_REDIRECT_URI` must exactly match what you register with that provider (swap `localhost:3000` for your real domain in production).

## Production deployment (Docker)

```sh
docker compose --env-file .env -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

This pulls the pre-built `server` image (serving both the API and the built frontend) from `ghcr.io/trentnbauer/squadqueue` - published automatically by the "Build and Publish Docker Image" GitHub Actions workflow on every change to `main` - and runs it alongside Postgres and Redis, all wired from the same `.env`. On first boot the container runs `prisma db push` automatically to create the schema. To pin a specific build instead of always tracking the latest, set `IMAGE_TAG=sha-<short-commit>` in `.env`.

### Running behind a reverse proxy

Most self-hosted setups put something in front of this container - a Cloudflare Tunnel, NGINX Proxy Manager, Traefik, etc - so it isn't exposed to the internet directly. `TRUST_PROXY` (in `.env`) defaults to `true`, which tells Fastify to derive the client's real IP/protocol from the `X-Forwarded-For`/`X-Forwarded-Proto` headers your proxy sets, rather than the raw connection it sees (which is typically plain HTTP inside Docker even when the outside world reaches you over HTTPS). This affects two things:

- **Session cookies** are marked `Secure` only once TLS is confirmed via `X-Forwarded-Proto` - so sign-in still works whether the proxy talks HTTP or HTTPS to the container, as long as your proxy forwards that header (Cloudflare Tunnel and NGINX Proxy Manager both do this by default).
- **Rate limiting** buckets requests by client IP - without `TRUST_PROXY`, every request looks like it comes from the proxy's own IP, so all your users would share one rate-limit bucket.

Only set `TRUST_PROXY=false` if this container is exposed directly with nothing in front of it (those headers are otherwise attacker-controllable). Whichever proxy you use, make sure `APP_BASE_URL` and each configured sign-in method's `*_REDIRECT_URI` point at your real public HTTPS domain, not `localhost`.

## Backups

Postgres and Redis data are bind-mounted to `./data/postgres` and `./data/redis` (override the root with `DATA_DIR` in `.env`). Point Borg, or any backup tool, at that `data/` directory.

## What's in Milestone 1 (and what isn't)

See the "Explicitly OUT of scope for Milestone 1" section of the implementation plan for the full list. Notably: no comment/discussion feature (voting only, by design), no real-time push (the UI refetches after actions), and console-platform games (Xbox/PlayStation/Switch) show metadata but no live price or gg.deals link — gg.deals' price API only covers Steam.

Game search/identity (title, cover art, platforms, Steam App ID) comes from IGDB; live pricing and the gg.deals purchase link come from gg.deals' official Prices API once a Steam App ID is known. Nothing scrapes gg.deals' website directly.
